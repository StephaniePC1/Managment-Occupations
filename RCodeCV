BASICS
<- rename
cdc[1:10,6]
name i want for df <- read.csv(file.choose(), header= TRUE)
dim(df)
names(df)
Specific colomun: df$name
max(df$name)
which.max(df$name)
df[row,column] :can be just a culumn or just a row.
plot (x axis, y axis, type= "l")
plot (x=variable, y=variable): scatterplot
pie(df)
barploat(df)
boxplot(df) - good for discrete and categorical
mean(cdc$weight) 
var(cdc$weight)
median(cdc$weight)
Categorical
table(cdc$smoke100) - counts the number of times each kind of response was given
barplot(table(cdc$smoke100))
mosaicplot(table(cdc$gender,cdc$smoke100))
mdata <- subset(cdc, cdc$gender == "m")
m_and_over30 <- subset(cdc, gender == "m" & age > 30)-and
m_or_over30 <- subset(cdc, gender == "m" | age > 30)-or
m_or_over30 <- subset(cdc, gender == 1) : that is if it is binary options
Quantitative
boxplot(cdc$height ~ cdc$gender)- The ~ character can be read versus or as a function of. So weâ€™re asking R to give us a box plots of heights where the groups are defined by gender.
hist(bmi) -histogram is good for continuous variable
hist(bmi, breaks = 50)
